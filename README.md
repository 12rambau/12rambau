## 👦 about me

Apart from being a developer, I enjoy most of my time being outdoors. In the winter, I am an avid skier and alpinist. During the warmer months here in Rome and south of France, I enjoye every type of bike (road biking, mountain biking, fixed gear biking), free climbing, and Outrigger Canoe. I spend most of my nights practicing Rowing at the [canottieri navalia](https://canottierinavalia.com).  
When forced indoors, I follow and watch lots of movies and television shows, and dive into Si-Fi books. I also play Saxophone but with a lack of practice as I spend a large amount of my free time reading comics and mangas.
